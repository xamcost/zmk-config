This ZMK shield, when added, replaces the built-in status screen with a custom one designed for use with 128x64-pixel OLED displays.
As it shows only the peripheral battery levels, it is recommended to be used on dongles only.

## Widgets
- active hid indicators (CLCK, NLCK, SLCK)
- active modifiers
- bongo cat
- highest layer name
- output status
- peripheral battery levels
